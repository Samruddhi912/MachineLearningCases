Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, and more.
It uses Logistic Regression for classification and handles missing/invalid values before training.

Dataset
Source: diabetes.csv (Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset)

Target column: Outcome
1 → Diabetic
0 → Non-diabetic

Features:
Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age

Features of the Code
Data Cleaning
Replaces 0 values in numeric features with their respective column mean.
Preserves the target column (Outcome) during preprocessing.
Data Splitting
Uses train_test_split with stratify to keep class distribution balanced.

Model Training
Logistic Regression from sklearn.linear_model.
Evaluates accuracy on both training and test data.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy score
Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
Confusion matrix

Requirements
->Python 3.7+
->pandas
->numpy
->scikit-learn
->matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)
